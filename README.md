# Money Management 

This is the front-end application responsible of the money management product. This application is essentially designed to be used on desktop.
I know that the core target of this kind of application will mainly used apps like this on mobile, however I don't have access to apple's license 
in order to create an application for this and I'm mainly a web developer.

This application is a side project for me, I use it to improve my skills, learn new things and it also solves a problem
that I personally had with my finances.

- Vite JS
- React 
- Zustand
- React-query
- Typescript
- Github pages for deployment -> This requires to use HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter due to how GithubPages works
- Shadcn for ui, a little of daisy-ui also
